**Random Blade** is a 1990s-style, browser-based warrior battle game built with Flask (Python), HTML, and CSS.  
Players choose from one of 10 retro warriors, each from a different historical era, then fight a random opponent.  
Each round, a random “roll” determines who takes damage, and the first whose health reaches 0 loses.

## Features
- 10 unique warrior cards (6 male, 4 female) styled like 90s fighting games (Guilty Gear/King of Fighters).  
- Numeric health bars (starts at 100, –10 per lost roll).  
- “Attack!” button triggers random damage each round.  
- Victory/Defeat/Draw banner with options to battle again or quit.  
- Retro neon/CRT aesthetic with pixel fonts.
